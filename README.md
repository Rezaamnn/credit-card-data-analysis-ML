Goal:

Our goal is to correctly identify the class:1 rows in this dataset in order to build a reliable model for fraud detection problems. After exploring and working with various models, I decided to start with the less complex model and popular baseline mode since the dataset is small after resampling and the features are limited. I selected the linear regression model which is the fundamental model in statistics and machine learning. This model is also less prone to overfitting which is a common issue with smaller datasets.


For future learning purposes, I like to try these few experiments with this project:
• Trying other resampling approaches such as over-sampling of the minority class in order to have a larger dataset.
• Managing the imbalanced data issue with weighting the classes in the modeling phase and using the original dataset.
• Implementing other models like Neural Networks and Random Forests with imbalanced data.
